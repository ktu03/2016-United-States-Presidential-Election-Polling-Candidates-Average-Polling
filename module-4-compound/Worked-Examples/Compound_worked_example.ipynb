    "\n",
    "The first thing I notice in this problem statement is that I need to design a data definition. I will open the Exam Sheet or the How to Design Data Definitions page so that I can be sure that I'm following the recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can see from the recipe that I need to identify the inherent structure of the information. I see that an address is made up of many associated pieces of information, which tells me that an address will need to be a compound. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, I need to decide what type to use for each field in the compound. I know that the street number will be a positive whole number (at least I've never seen a street number that's not!), so I'll use an positive `int` for this field. A street name and the city name should be strings because it's not possible to enumerate all of the names of streets or cities in Canada. A postal code is a tricky one; it has a very particular format, so I could choose to make a data definition to ensure that all postal codes in my program match the intended format. In this case, I don't want to worry about checking the formatting so I'll use a `str` to represent the postal code. I know that there are exactly 10 provinces and three territories in Canada, so the most appropriate choice would be an enumeration. Since we haven't yet learned how to reference other user-defined data types from our data definitions, I'll use a `str` for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I've identified the inherent structure of all of the information and I've decided how I will represent that information as data in my program. I'm ready to start working on my data definition for address."
