    "    \n",
    "A. We saw an example last lecture, when we learned about \"early returns\".  Generally, searching a list can be performed without an accumulator.  If the return value potentially depends on more than one element of a list, you will need an accumulator.  If you do not need an accumulator, you can delete the accumulator part of the template.  Ideally you would also leave a comment like \"no accumulator needed\", but that is not strictly necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "B. Generally speaking, each data structure is used for different types of data:  \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Lists for an arbitrary number of data values all of the same type.  </li>\n",
    "        <li> Compound for a fixed set of data values which are all related and which all must be present, but may be of different types.  </li>\n",
    "        <li>Enum for a single data value which can take on only a (relatively small) number of possible values.  </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "C. The body of the loop is repeated once for each element of `lon`.  The variable `n` is called the loop variable.  On the first repeat of the body of the loop, `n` is the first element of `lon`.  On the second repeat  of the body of the loop `n` is the second element of `lon`.  Follow the pattern until on the last repeat of the body of the loop `n` is the last element of `lon`.  If we were looping over a list of type `DataType`, then we would typically call the list `lodt` and the loop variable `dt`.\n",
