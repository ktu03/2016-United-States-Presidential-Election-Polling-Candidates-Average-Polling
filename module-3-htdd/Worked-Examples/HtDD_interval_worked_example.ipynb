    "The first thing I need to think about is the structure of the information that I need to represent as data in my program. Here, I'm asked to represent someone's salary. The problem statement doesn't specify whether it's a weekly salary, monthly salary, annual salary, or salary for some other time period. I need to decide which of these makes the most sense. Since most people mean annual salary when they discuss salaries, I will work on representing someone's annual salary as information in my program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I need to think more specifically about the information that I will want to represent. What range of values may I need to represent? Many people don't work, so I may need to represent a salary of \\\\$0 per year. I won't ever need to represent a negative salary because no one could possibly have a negative salary. I don't know what the highest paid person in the world makes, so it's not possible for me to determine a maximum value. Most people probably have salaries that are in whole dollars (e.g. \\\\$50,000 per year not \\\\$50,000.24 per year). However, some people may have salaries that include a non-zero number of cents. I need to make a decision here; do I want to be able to represent salaries that have some number of cents or is it good enough to round to the closest dollar? This may depend on the way in which the data definition will be used. If I was creating a data definition that would actually be used in a company's payroll system, I would need to come up with a precise way of storing the number of dollars and cents in someone's annual salary. Often salary increases are given as a percentage, so even if someone's starting salary was in whole dollars (with no cents), they may end up with a non-integer salary after some number of salary increases. Since this example will not be used in an actual payroll program, I think it's sufficient to think of someone's salary in whole dollars. That means that I'll have to round to the nearest integer any time I'm updating a salary in a program that uses this data definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of that thinking about what information I need to represent leads me to the kind of data definition that I will need to create. I've now decided that the information I want to represent is whole dollars with a minimum of zero and no maximum. I can represent that as data in my program with an interval of integers that has a minimum of zero and no maximum."
