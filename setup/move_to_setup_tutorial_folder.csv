This is a file that is in the wrong spot!

If you ever want to submit multiple files in your tutorial, you need to ensure that ALL the files you want to submit are in the same directory (i.e., folder). Use the Syzygy interface to move this file into the Tutorial folder and then submit it together with the tutorial. 

You should ALWAYS double check your submission on Canvas after submitting to ensure that all the files you want have been submitted and the content of each file is as expected.
