One such [set of information](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-surgical-wait-times) lists the median (50th percentile) and 90th percentile wait times for surgeries in different hospitals around BC as well as province-wide wait times. Design an analysis program to analyze the information in [surgical_wait_times_annual.csv](surgical_wait_times_annual.csv) to determine which type of surgery has the longest median wait time in 2015/2016."

So, I need to update the signature for read.\n",

    "Now I need to work on some examples for read. The information file is very large, so I can't test that all the lines are read correctly. (Otherwise I'd be checking over 17000 surgery wait times!) So, I will create two small test files that I can use to test read.\n",

    "\n",

I will look back at my data definition and see that I need (in this order) the name of the surgery group, the health authority, the fiscal year, and the median wait time. The first three are represented as strings, so I don't need to parse them further. The median wait time is represented as a float, so I need to be able to convert the string that I'll get from the csv reader into a float.

I'll start by using some of the output from my read examples as input for my analyze function. I know that my analyze function needs to take output from my read function because of the way we've composed analyze and read in the main function.\n",

I need to consider this case. What should the analyze function return if none of the wait times are from 2015/2016? Since there are no times to examine to consider which has the longest wait time, I think this function should return `None` in this case. I need to edit my signature/purpose to reflect this update.\n",

    "Note: I thought about the analyze function carefully before, but I didn't realize that it might need to return None until I was working on the examples. It's fairly common to have to make changes to the design as you go. It's important to make sure that the changes are applied consistently across the whole program. For this program, I also need to change the return type, purpose, and examples for main as it may now return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to analyze - now I need to complete the template. In order to solve this problem, I need to do three distinct operations. First, I need to filter the list of input so that it only includes surgery wait times from 2015/2016. Then, I need to filter that list so that it only includes entries with health authority 'All Health Authorities'. Finally, I need to search through that list to find the longest median wait time. Since there are three distinct operations, I will template this as a function composition.\n",
