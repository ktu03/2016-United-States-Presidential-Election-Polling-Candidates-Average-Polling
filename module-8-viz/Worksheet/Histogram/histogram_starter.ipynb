    "# Problem Description\n",

    "Design a program that uses \"Benford's Law\" to investigate whether there may have been fraudulent voting data released in the 2009 Iranian Presidential Election. [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) describes the expected distribution of \"leading digits\" of numbers in commonly occurring numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leading digit of a number is the leftmost digit in that number. For example, the leading digit of 12,982 is 1, while the leading digit of 370 is 3. Note that for positive integers, the leading digit can never be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benford's Law predicts that leading 1's are more common than leading 2's, leading 2's more common than leading 3's, 3's more common than 4's, and so forth. The particular predicted frequency is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you should produce a histogram of the number of leading digits that are 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, 7's, 8's, and 9's in votes for Karrubi in the file `2009-iranian-presidential-election-votes.csv` and then compare that to the [plot of the expected frequencies in the Benford's Law article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law#/media/File:Rozklad_benforda.svg).\n",

    "However, we've been asked to perform a very specific analysis, charting the frequency of leading digits in the information.
