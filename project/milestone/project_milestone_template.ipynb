The names are crucial as they will each represent a single bar on the bar chart. Each poll has a state of either \"US\" or any individual state in the United States. If the state indicates \"US\", that means it is a nationwide poll. If the state is not \"US\", then it is an individual state so it is a statewide poll. The overall polling scores of nationwide and statewide polls are weighted evenly into the final average polling score so knowing if it is a statewide or nationwide poll is absolutely necessary.
