    "The cycle of the American election, which is 2016 for all polls as this was presidential polls conducted from 2016. There is a forecast date, which is November 1st 2016 for all polls as they are forecasted after all the polls close, which is close to that day. There is a state that the poll was conducted which is the location indicator in this context. The start and end dates indicate when the poll started conducting information, and when it stopped. The pollster is the source and the media/organization that conducted the poll. The branch represents the branch of government in which this election is for, which is by default President for all polls. The matchup indicates who's polling numbers will be assessed in the poll, and for all of them it is Trump, Clinton, and Johnson. The type of poll is Polls Plus for all of them which is a type that combines the economic index with the polls. The sample size indicates how many people were surveyed or participated in the poll. The raw poll numbers for each candidate indicate their polling score before making adjustments and factoring in elements of polls plus (economic index). The adjusted poll numbers are the finalized polling scores for each candidate after factoring in the elements of polls plus. The URL is the link to the source of the poll. Each poll also has a poll ID. Some columns for the adjusted and raw polls of Gary Johnson are empty (this is mainly because his polling score were a lot lower compared to Clinton and Trump). Many other ambiguous data is present. There is a grade given for each poll, a population that is labelled \"lv\" for each poll, a raw poll and adjusted poll number for McMullin, a candidate not considered in any of the polls (column is completely empty). There is also a column labelled \"multiversions\" which is complete empty. Each poll has a question ID which has ambiguous meaningness and there is a create date for each poll where in some cases, is later than the date it started conducting results which does not make sense. There is also a time stamp for each poll which apparently is the same for all polls.\n",
